## Description
Group project repo for data analysis course of INST447. Our project domain is real estate prices in various zip codes within the Washington metropolitan area (heretofore referred to as the DMV). The primary goal of our project is to retrieve, analyze, and present data which may be used to draw inferences and inform personal or business investment decisions revolving around real estate going into the year 2023. We believe that this data may reveal homogenous traits among certain zip codes which may be correlated with trends in the real estate market.

## Scope
Our scope includes data about the historical trends of the price of rental properties, house values, forecasted house values, and list/sale prices, as well as information about population growth in various zip codes (which usually align with a particular city’s borders) within the DMV (Ex. Bethesda, Rockville, Reston, Alexandria, Washington D.C.) Our objective is to answer questions about the real estate market in the Washington metropolitan area such as:
* Which zip codes had the greatest increase and decrease in home ownership / residents over time
* Which zip codes experienced the greatest increase or decrease in home value (rental prices, house value on market) historically
* Where might the next booming market be, or which zip code(s) have the highest growth potential


## Data Source:
We used Zillow as our sole source of data acquisition for our project. Zillow is a well-established American real estate marketplace which offers real estate data of a wide array of variables across the various levels (city, state, national) of the US real estate market. The comprehensiveness of their database meant that we were able to acquire all relevant data about rental and housing prices in the DMV from Zillow alone. We chose five key datasets from Zillow’s database which we deemed relevant to our project: 
* A high level analysis of average historical home values of all 3 regions in the DMV by state (DC, MD, VA)
* A high level analysis of average historical home values of all 3 regions in the DMV separated by zip code
* A high level analysis of average historical home values for each state in the USA
* A high level analysis of average historical rent prices in all 3 regions of the DMV by state
* A high level analysis of average historical prices for rental properties in the DMV separated by city
